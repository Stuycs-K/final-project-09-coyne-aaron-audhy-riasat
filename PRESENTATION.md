# VIC Cipher Presentation
By Riasat Audhy & Aaron Coyne


## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

- Late 19th century Russian Nihilists created and used the Nihilist cipher to organize terrorism against the tsarist regime.
  - This involves a 5 by 5 "Polybius square" to encrypt text (shown below).

- This basic cipher was similar to the Vigenère cipher, and not very secure. However, by World War II, it had evolved into a very strong cipher.
  - The two biggest changes made were that instead of a Polybius square, a Straddling checkerboard (shown below) was used and that all addition was done mod 10.

- The final development / evolutionary pinnacle was the VIC cipher that was used in the 1950s by  Reino Häyhänen.
  - It kept the Straddling checkerboard & modulo addition.
  - At this time most Soviet angents used one-time pad ciphers.
  - It resisted all cryptanalysis by the NSA until Häyhänen defected.
