# Work Log

## AARON COYNE

### 2024-05-23

We read into VIC, blowfish, and Solitaire ciphers and decided on doing our project with VIC.

### 2024-05-24

Was absent from class.

At home, I watched this video on the VIC cipher:

### 2024-05-28

Did a lot of research on each aspect of the VIC cipher (Straddling Checkerboard, Chain Addition, Modular addition / subtraction) and began planning out how we would do it in Java.

### 2024-05-29

Continued learning about the components.

### 2024-05-30

Working on implementing digit encode. Will implement sequencing next.

https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs108/cs108.1092/JavaBasicRefresher.pdf

Read through this document in class to get refreshed on using Java for the project.

### 2024-05-28

We started breaking down how we would implement the cipher, and learned how a bunch of the components work (Straddling Checkerboard, Chain Addition, Modular addition / subtraction).

### 2024-05-29

Continued learning about the components.

### 2024-05-30

Created the files to start coding. Currently working on implementing digit by digit modular (base 10) addition and subtraction. Will implement chain addition next.
